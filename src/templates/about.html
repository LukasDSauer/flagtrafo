        <i>flagtrafo</i> was developed by Lukas D. Sauer at the Heidelberg Institute of Theoretical Studies
        in 2019, under the supervision of Anna Wienhard.
        A special thanks goes to Sven Gr√ºtzmacher: His Master's thesis code contributed to the library
        <i>projflag-lib</i>, which is used for the server-side calculations of the flag complexes.

        This application was designed using Flask, nginx, Milligram.css and D3.js.
